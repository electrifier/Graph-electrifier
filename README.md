## What is this site about?
electrifier is a project i've been working on in my spare time for some years now.

I've re-written several parts many times. It's just a fun project to test out what's happening in .net - world. The Original .net-version just brought tab-support to _Windows File Explorer_ ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰.
 
When I heard about WinApp SDK last year, I was very excited. I never used WPF for perfomance reasons, but I love WinUI.

I also like using [@dahall/Vanara](https://github.com/dahall/Vanara) by [David Hall](https://github.com/dahall). It's a great project, for everyone who's interested. It's not _that other WinAPI-Abstraction Layer_ but a complete shell around about every native windows API.
 
And It's a great source for good practices.

[Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/graph/) will be used for _Cloud Features_: Think of a history of when I have worked on or with
* that project,
* that document,
* on this device.
 
Cloud features are still WIP. But I think, Microsoft Graph sounds the place to store the database stuff I want to collect and analyze.
