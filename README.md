## What is this site about?
electrifier is a project i've been working on in my spare time for some years now. Several parts had been re-written:

* The Original Windows Forms version brought tab-support to _Windows File Explorer_ ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰.
The project has been archived in the meantime, but you may make a fork here:

* When I heard about WinApp SDK last year, I was very excited. I never used WPF for perfomance reasons, but I love WinUI.

## Contributors:

* [David Hall](https://github.com/dahall)'s great [@dahall/Vanara](https://github.com/dahall/Vanara) project. It's not _that other WinAPI-Abstraction Layer_ but a complete collection of wrappers around every classic, good old *Windows 32 API*. And It's a great source for good practices.
* The great people at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/) for providing a open source license of their fabulous JetBrains ToolBox. Thx a lot!

## Used Techniques
* [Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/graph/) will be used for _Cloud Features_
  A history will keep track of which ressources you were using on this or that device.
